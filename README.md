# PortInspector
 Port Inspector is a Python-based port scanning tool that allows users to scan network ports on target hosts, identify  open ports, and generate detailed reports of the findings.  This project was created as a final project for CS50x, implementing security best practices and providing both  command-line and interactive interfaces.
